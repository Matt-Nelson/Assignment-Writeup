Hello potential grader!

I carried out the analysis and built my .Rmd file for this assignment in time, but when I went to knit the filte to HTML, the three random forest models I had built had to be redone and they are taking a very long time to finish, so it's looking like I will not have the HTML file ready for grading by the deadline. I will get the file in place as soon as I can, but will completely understand if you choose to award no points for this assignment because I was unable to get the HTML document in place in time.

Thanks!

The HTML knit finally finished. You can preview the HTML file by using this address: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Matt-Nelson/Assignment-Writeup/blob/master/ActivityClassification.html
